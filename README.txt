The **Online Editor** plugin displays a code editor in Z-Ray whenever you click the Show in IDE icon instead of opening the file in your IDE, allowing seamless online editing of your code. 

Any changes made to your code are saved in the files themselves, and you can even select between different themes to change the editor look and feel.

Note: The Online Editor runs with the same permissions as the PHP user, which may be limited based on your operating system.
